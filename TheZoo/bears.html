    <p><strong>Bears</strong> are mammals of the family <strong>Ursidae</strong>. Bears are classified as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans, with the pinnipeds being their closest living   relatives. Although there are only eight living species of bear, they are widespread, appearing in a   wide variety of habitats throughout   the Northern   Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. Bears are found in the continents of North America, South America, Europe, and Asia.</p>
    <p>Common characteristics of modern bears include a large body with stocky legs,   a long snout, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and   a short tail. While the polar   bear is mostly carnivorous and the giant panda feeds almost entirely on bamboo, the remaining six species are   omnivorous, with largely varied diets including both plants and animals.</p>
    <p>With the exceptions of courting individuals and mothers with their young, bears are typically solitary animals.   They are generally diurnal, but   may be active during the night (nocturnal) or twilight (crepuscular), particularly around humans. Bears are   aided by an excellent sense of   smell, and despite their heavy build and awkward gait, they can run quickly   and are adept climbers and swimmers. In autumn some bear species forage large   amounts of fermented fruits which affects their behaviour. Bears use shelters such as caves and burrows as their dens, which are occupied   by most species during the winter for a long period of sleep similar to hibernation.</p>
    <p>Bears have been hunted since prehistoric times for their meat and fur. To this   day, they play a prominent role in the arts, mythology, and other cultural aspects of various   human societies. In modern times, the bear's existence has been pressured   through the encroachment on its habitats and the illegal trade of bears and bear   parts, including the Asian bile bear market. The IUCN lists six bear species as vulnerable or endangered, and   even least   concern species such as the brown bear are at risk of extirpation in   certain countries. The poaching and international trade of these most threatened   populations is prohibited, but still ongoing.</p>
