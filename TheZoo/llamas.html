    <p>The <strong>llama</strong> is a South American camelid, widely used as a pack and meat animal by Andean cultures since pre-hispanic times.</p>
    <p>The height of a full-grown, full-size llama is between 1.7 meters (5.5 ft)   and 1.8 meters (6 ft) tall at the top of the head. They can weigh between   approximately 130 kilograms (280 lb) and 200 kilograms (450 lb). At birth, a baby llama (called a <em>cria</em>) can weigh   between 9.1 kilograms (20 lb) and 14 kilograms (30 lb). Llamas are very social   animals and like to live with other llamas as a herd. Overall, the fiber produced by a llama is very soft   and is naturally lanolin free. Llamas   are intelligent and can learn simple tasks after a few repetitions. When using a pack, llamas can carry about 25% to   30% of their body weight for several miles.</p>
    <p>Llamas appear to have originated from the central plains of North America about 40   million years ago. They migrated to South   America about 3 million years ago. By the end of the last ice age (10,000–12,000 years ago) camelids were extinct   in North America. As of 2007,   there were over 7 million llamas and alpacas in South America and, due to importation from   South America in the late 20th century, there are now over 158,000 llamas and   100,000 alpacas in the US and Canada.</p>
