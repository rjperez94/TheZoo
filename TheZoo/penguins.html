    <p><strong>Penguins</strong> (order <strong>Sphenisciformes</strong>, family <strong>Spheniscidae</strong>) are a group of aquatic, flightless birds living almost exclusively in the southern hemisphere, especially in Antarctica. Highly adapted for life   in the water, penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage, and their   wings have become flippers. Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid, and   other forms of sealife caught while swimming underwater. They spend   about half of their lives on land and half in the oceans.</p>
    <p>Although all penguin species are native to the southern hemisphere, they are   not found only in cold climates, such as Antarctica. In fact, only a few species   of penguin live so far south. Several species are found in the temperate zone, and   one species, the Galápagos Penguin, lives near the   equator.</p>
    <p>The largest living species is the Emperor Penguin (<em>Aptenodytes forsteri</em>):   adults average about 1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall and weigh 35 kg (75 lb) or more. The smallest penguin species   is the Little Blue   Penguin (<em>Eudyptula minor</em>), also known as the Fairy Penguin, which   stands around 40 cm tall (16 in) and weighs 1 kg (2.2 lb). Among extant   penguins, larger penguins inhabit colder regions, while smaller penguins are   generally found in temperate or even tropical climates (<em>see also</em> Bergmann's Rule). Some prehistoric species attained   enormous sizes, becoming as tall or as heavy as an adult human. These were not   restricted to Antarctic regions; on the contrary, subantarctic regions harboured high diversity, and   at least one giant penguin occurred in a region not quite 2,000 km south of the equator 35 mya, in a climate decidedly   warmer than today.</p>
